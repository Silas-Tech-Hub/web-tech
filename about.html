        <h1>Hi, I'm Silas M</h1>
        <p>
            Hi there, web development isn't just about writing codes; it's about<br>
            continuous learning and the thrilling process of taking an idea from <br>
            a blank screen to fully functional application.I'm currently obsessed <br>
            with learning the intricacies of asynchronous javascript and the craft <br>
            of pixe-perfect CSS design.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I'm still building my experience, my commitment is to write clean,<br>
            documented codes and always prioritize the user experience. I love tackling <br>
            new challenges and am always looking for side projects that force me to step <br>
            outside my comfort zone.
        </p>
